Objective
To develop a simple quiz game that presents multiple choice questions to the user.The game keeps track of the user's score and provides feedback based on their answers.

Key Activities
Understanding the problem: The quiz game requires multiple-choice questions, user input, score tracking, and feedback.
Program designing: Structure of the program and planning on how to display questions and collecting answers from the user is done. Also, framework for feedback mechanism and score tracking is also designed.
Development environment: Choosing a text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is the next step. A C compiler should be available for compiling and executing the program.
Testing the program: The program is compiled to check for syntax errors and it is tested with various inputs to ensure the program runs as expected.
De-bugging the program: The program is checked for any bugs and the code is refined to handle edge cases.
Technologies used
C Programming language
VSS Code
